            <h2>Pottery</h2>
            <p>I have been practicing pottery for 2+ years at various studios, currently I work at Mudstone Studio in Pawtuket, RI. 
                My number-one goal is to create the perfect coffee mug, a pursuit that I am sure will take my whole life. I am drawn to 
                the idea of creating an object that is intimately connected to its use, and adds joy to the experience of use. I think the 
                objects we surround ourselves with should be special, beautiful, functional, and natural. I derive huge inspiration from 
                the production philosophy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawan" target="none">Chawan</a>.
