            <h2>Pottery</h2>
            <p>I have been practicing pottery for 2+ years at various studios, currently I work at Mudstone Studio in Pawtuket, RI. 
                My number-one goal is to create the perfect coffee mug, a pursuit that I am sure will take my whole life. I am drawn to 
                the idea of creating an object that is intimately connected to its use, and adds joy to the experience of use. I think the 
                objects we surround ourselves with should be special, beautiful, functional, and natural. I derive huge inspiration from 
                the production philosophy of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawan" target="none">Chawan</a>.

                I finally photographed some of the pieces that came out of my time at the Steel Yard. I am quite happy with these, the experiment with 
                burnishing the outside of pots and then giving bit of highlight to the texture with an oxide wash worked beautifully. I think I have really 
                found my design language with these natural curves, pronounced feet, and raw clay exterior. I am now starting to produce some work 
                at my first full time ceramics home at <a href="https://www.mudstonestudios.com/" target="none">Mudstone Studio</a> in Pawtucket, RI. 
                New work will be focused on form, making pieces with natural curves and simple unglazed exterriors that feel at home in the hands.

            <p>
                I am currently doing work in the intermidiate guided open studio at <a href="https://www.thesteelyard.org/" target="none">The Steel Yard</a> 
                in Providence, RI. For now I have decided to focus on form and hone those related skills before moving on to textural work (which I am also interested in). 
                As such, my pieces in this class will be all raw clay body on the outside, with a simple glaze lining on the inside. I pre-plan the dimensions of pieces and 
                attempt to throw and trim sets which are as alike as possible. The outsides of all trimmed pots are burnished with a metal spoon, which gives a delightful 
                smooth texture to the greenware...we will see how this comes through in the final peices. The instructor, Fred, opened my eyes to the fact that the clay 
                body used for these classes is a bit ugly when left unglazed. Perhaps I will attempt a subtle oxide wash just to give the pieces a little bit of contrast 
                as opposed to the flat yellow-beige of the raw glaze-fired clay. A couple of the residents in ceramics recommended that I simply use a clay 
                body that I think is beautiful if I want the raw clay to be beautiful, and I think this is good advice. Perhaps I should do some tests and find a 
                clay to stick to before going too much further.
